## Important Options

* `templates_dir`: If it's the same as `posts_dir`, the two are combined.
* `install_shell_session`: Chooses whether or not to install the prebuilt `shell_session` macro

## Useful Features

* Builds with a Sublime project that also contains a `build_system`. Building in a Jinja file will compile the posts.
* WIP
